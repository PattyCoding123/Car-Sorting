# Lab-Example-22
Console application that allows user to manage a list of car parts.
The user will be able to search for a car part, add a car part to the list, remove a part,
and sort the list. The sorting algorithm used to sort the car parts list is a selection sort.
To find the correct car part, a binary search algorithm was used. The user may choose to leave 
the program at any time. An additional change to make would be to include some condition to 
check if the choice that user entered was valid or not, which can also be included as the default
outcome for the switch statement.
